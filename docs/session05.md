## Testing Your Implementation

A critical aspect of software development is ensuring your code works as intended. Let's create strategies for AI-assisted testing.

### Creating a Testing Prompt Template

Create an `@test.md` prompt template:

```markdown
# Testing Strategy

When I ask you to test a specific component or feature, please:

1. Analyze the implementation to identify:
   - Core functionality to verify
   - Edge cases to test
   - Potential failure modes

2. Develop a comprehensive testing approach including:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - System tests for end-to-end functionality
   - Performance tests (if applicable)

3. Implement test code with:
   - Clear test case descriptions
   - Appropriate assertions
   - Meaningful test data
   - Both positive and negative test cases

4. Analyze test coverage to identify:
   - Areas with insufficient testing
   - Critical paths that need additional verification

5. Suggest improvements to make the code more testable

6. If not yet part of a user story or task add the tests to it

If you find issues during test development, propose specific code changes to address them.
```

### Example Testing Workflow

**User:**
```
Please follow the instructions in @test.md for the FontRepository component.
```


## Documenting Your Project

Documentation is essential for both users and future developers. Let's create a framework for comprehensive documentation.

### Creating a Documentation Prompt Template

Create an `@document.md` prompt:

```markdown
# Documentation Generation

When I ask you to document a component, feature, or the entire project, please:

1. For code documentation:
   - Write clear XML comments for all public APIs
   - Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
   - Include usage examples
   - Document non-obvious design decisions

2. For user-facing documentation:
   - Create a README.md with:
     - Project overview
     - Installation instructions
     - Usage examples
     - Configuration options
   - Create specific user guides for key features

3. For architectural documentation:
   - Document high-level architecture
   - Describe component interactions
   - Explain design patterns used
   - Provide diagrams (using text-based formats)

4. For development documentation:
   - Development environment setup
   - Build and test instructions
   - Contribution guidelines
   - Known issues and workarounds

Make documentation comprehensive yet concise, focusing on what users and developers need to know.
```

### Example Documentation Workflow

**User:**
```
Please follow the instructions in @document.md to create a README.md for our ASCII font renderer project.
```


## Tracking Project Progress

A well-managed project keeps accurate records of what's completed and what remains to be done. Let's create tools for tracking and updating project status.

### Creating a Project Status Update Template

Create an `@update-status.md` prompt:

```markdown
# Project Status Update

When I ask you to update the project status, please:

1. Review all user stories and tasks in the .project directory
2. For each task:
   - Determine if it's implemented
   - Verify which acceptance criteria are met
   - Update the task file with completion status

3. For each user story:
   - Calculate completion percentage based on tasks
   - Update the user story file with completion status

4. Update index files:
   - Update USER-STORIES.MD with completion percentages
   - Update TASKS.MD with completion status

5. Create or update a PROJECT-STATUS.MD file with:
   - Overall project completion percentage
   - Completed features
   - In-progress features
   - Pending features
   - Known issues

6. Compare current state against the project overview to verify alignment with goals

Present a summary of the current project status and highlight any concerns or misalignments.
```

### Example Status Update Workflow

**User:**
```
Please follow the instructions in @update-status.md
```


## Refining the End-to-End Process

As your project nears completion, it's valuable to reflect on and refine your AI collaboration process.

### Creating a Process Improvement Prompt

Create an `@improve-process.md` prompt:

```markdown
# Process Improvement Review

Let's analyze our development process to identify improvements for future projects:

1. Review our current workflow:
   - What worked well?
   - What challenges did we encounter?
   - Where did we spend the most time?

2. Analyze prompts effectiveness:
   - Which prompts were most helpful?
   - Which prompts need refinement?
   - What new prompts would be beneficial?

3. Evaluate implementation quality:
   - Code consistency and standards
   - Documentation quality
   - Test coverage
   - Project organization

4. Suggest specific improvements:
   - Template modifications
   - New prompt strategies
   - Process adjustments
   - Tool integrations

Let's document these learnings to continuously improve our AI collaboration approach.
```

## Final Project Review

Before considering the project complete, conduct a comprehensive review to ensure everything meets standards.

### Creating a Final Review Prompt

Create an `@final-review.md` prompt:

```markdown
# Final Project Review

Before considering this project complete, let's conduct a comprehensive review:

1. Code Quality Assessment:
   - Adherence to coding standards
   - Proper error handling
   - Security considerations
   - Performance optimization opportunities
   - Consistency across codebase

2. Documentation Review:
   - API documentation completeness
   - User documentation clarity
   - Architecture documentation accuracy
   - Update any outdated documentation

3. Testing Verification:
   - Test coverage analysis
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance test results
   - User acceptance test criteria

4. Project Management Review:
   - All user stories properly updated
   - All tasks marked appropriately
   - Index files accurate and up-to-date
   - Project goals achieved

5. Future Considerations:
   - Maintenance recommendations
   - Potential future enhancements
   - Known limitations
   - Deployment considerations

Provide a detailed report with recommendations for any final adjustments before project completion.
```

2. Select a component from your project
3. Use the template to develop a comprehensive testing strategy
4. Implement at least three key test cases

### Exercise 2: Documentation Generation
1. Create the `@document.md` template
2. Generate a README.md for your project
3. Add code documentation to at least one key class
4. Create a simple user guide for one feature

### Exercise 3: Status Tracking
1. Create the `@update-status.md` template
2. Run a full project status update
3. Review the generated status report
4. Make adjustments to ensure accuracy

### Exercise 4: Process Review

2. Conduct a review of your AI collaboration process
3. Identify at least three specific improvements
4. Update your templates based on these improvements

## Advanced Project Maintenance

For ongoing projects, consider these additional prompt templates:

### Release Preparation

Create an `@prepare-release.md` template:

```markdown
# Release Preparation

When preparing for a release, please:

1. Create a comprehensive release checklist
2. Verify all features are complete and tested
3. Generate release notes from completed user stories
4. Update version numbers and documentation
5. Create deployment instructions
6. Identify post-release monitoring steps
```

### Technical Debt Management

Create an `@tech-debt.md` template:

```markdown
# Technical Debt Tracking

Please analyze our code to identify technical debt:

1. List areas with significant technical debt
2. Categorize by type (design, testing, documentation, etc.)
3. Rate by severity and estimated effort to address
4. Suggest refactoring approaches for each item
5. Create technical debt user stories for tracking
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Comprehensive testing** transforms functional code into reliable software
- **Documentation** ensures others can use and maintain your project
- **Status tracking** provides visibility and accountability
- **Process improvement** creates compound benefits over time
- **Final review** catches issues before they affect users

The techniques in this workshop create a powerful, iterative approach to software development with AI assistance that:

1. Structures your thinking and requirements
2. Automates tedious documentation
3. Improves implementation quality
4. Ensures comprehensive testing
5. Keeps projects organized and on track

Most importantly, this approach creates a **learning system** where your AI collaboration becomes more effective with each project as both you and your prompts evolve.
